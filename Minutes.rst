Present: Tim, Dominic, Leo. Documents: `Draft proposals`_.

- Objectives: decide on project so the proposal can be written; clarify role of supervisors.
- Discussed Tim's work on Dijkstra and the corresponding Coq proof script
- Idea: formalise "big operators" in Agda, similar to ``bigops`` in Coq (part of ssreflect).
- Next steps (Leo): research previous work and write proposal until early next week.
