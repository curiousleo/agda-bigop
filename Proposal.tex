% Current research into routing protocols seeks to formalise the assumptions made by routing algorithms in terms of the underlying algebraic structures, most notably variations and combinations of semirings.
% 
% This has lead to some surprising results -- for example, Dijkstra's algorithm requires much less structure from the underlying algebraic entity than previously thought.
% 
% The purpose of this project would be to prove one or more variants of the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm or the Dijkstra algorithm correct while taking care to make as few assumptions as possible about the underlying algebraic structure. This will require me to:
% 
% - Translate the algebraic structures used in the analysis of routing protocols into Agda types and data structures. Some standard entities from abstract algebra already exist in Agda's standard library, others would have to be newly implemented;
% - Find minimal sets of assumptions that make the routing algorithms correct; and
% - Prove the correctness of the routing algorithms based on these assumptions in Agda.


\begin{abstract}
Dijkstra's algorithm in its most common form computes globally optimal paths with respect to some metric, which must satisfy certain laws. Recently, it has been shown that Dijkstra's algorithm computes \emph{locally} optimal paths even when the underlying metric is not distributive \autocite{sobrinho_routing_2010}. A proof of correctness not assuming distributivity has been formalised in the theorem prover Coq, but it is complex and hard to understand for someone not intimately familiar with Coq. I will reconstruct this proof in Agda, a dependent type theory, aiming to simplify it and make it easier to read. This will require me to develop several libraries for the proof to build upon. These libraries may be of interest for the wider Agda community, so they will be designed with reusability in mind.

\section{Introduction%
  \label{introduction}%
}

At the core of most routing protocols lies some variant of either the Bellman-Ford algorithm or Dijkstra's algorithm. Both compute globally optimal paths with respect to some metric, given that the metric satisfies a set of laws. Metrics and the rules that describe how they compose can be modelled as algebraic structures. In this framework, the common set of assumptions for a metric used in Dijkstra's algorithm is represented by a semiring. This structure contains two operators, usually written \(\oplus\) and \(\otimes\). In semirings, \(\otimes\) is left- and right-distributive over \(\oplus\); textbook correctness proofs commonly imply this (XXX ref to Intro to Algorithms).

Sobrinho and Griffin showed that when the metric is non-distributive, Dijkstra's algorithm still computes locally optimal paths, which are defined as the solutions to fixed-point equations over the graph's adjacency matrix. They provided a formal proof of this result written in Coq, an interactive theorem prover. This proof makes heavy use proof-constructing metaprogramming facilities called \emph{tactics}. Whilst convenient for writing proofs, tactics make the proof file harder to read: in many places, instead of the actual proof of a lemma or theorem, it contains a call to a metaroutine that constructs the proof. The overall proof is of course still correct (assuming that Coq's underlying logic is sound), but it is hard to see \emph{why} this is the case.

Agda, like Coq, is both a dependently typed programming language and a higher-order type theory.\footnote{More specifically, Coq is based on Coquand and Huet's \enquote{calculus of inductive constructions} whereas Agda is based on Luo's \enquote{unifying theory of dependent types}.} It does not support tactics but includes flexible syntax for dependent pattern matching. Proofs in Agda are generally considered easier to read for non-experts than their Coq equivalents. The goal of this project is to port the correctness proof described above from Coq to Agda. In doing so, I will try to find ways to improve the readability of the proof.

Users of Coq can draw on a large set of libraries of proofs and tactics. The existing correctness proof for Dijkstra's algorithm over non-distributive metrics builds on a Coq library called \texttt{ssreflect} that formalises, amongst other things, the notion of \enquote{big operators} \autocite{bertot_canonical_2008}. This module allows proof authors to derive big operators from small operators and a collection of objects to iterate over. For example, \(\sum_{i=1}^n f(i)\) can be constructed from the small operator \(+\) and the list of natural numbers \([1, \dots, n]\).

The younger Agda project has not yet caught up with other theorem provers in terms of the size of its standard library and the number of third-party components available. At this time, no equivalent of Coq's big operator library exists for Agda, although steps in this direction have been made \autocite{gustafsson_foldable_2014}. A general purpose formalisation of matrix algebra and basic linear algebra is currently also missing. Since the proof that is to be ported to Agda depends on these and other notions, I will have to develop their representation in Agda as part of this project. Matrices and big operators are commonly used concepts, so it is reasonable to expect that libraries formalising them will be of general interest to the wider Agda community. I will therefore design any auxiliary libraries with reusability in mind, aiming to write idiomatic code that could be included in the Agda standard library.

Time permitting, I will use the definitions developed for the correctness proof to explore further topics in algebraic path finding in Agda.

In summary, I propose to reconstruct a proof of correctness of Dijkstra's algorithm over non-distributive metrics in the dependently typed programming language cum theorem prover Agda, along with the acoompanying libraries of useful definitions and lemmas which are currently missing from the Agda ecosystem.
