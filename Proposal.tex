\maketitle

% Current research into routing protocols seeks to formalise the assumptions made by routing algorithms in terms of the underlying algebraic structures, most notably variations and combinations of semirings.
% 
% This has lead to some surprising results -- for example, Dijkstra's algorithm requires much less structure from the underlying algebraic entity than previously thought.
% 
% The purpose of this project would be to prove one or more variants of the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm or the Dijkstra algorithm correct while taking care to make as few assumptions as possible about the underlying algebraic structure. This will require me to:
% 
% - Translate the algebraic structures used in the analysis of routing protocols into Agda types and data structures. Some standard entities from abstract algebra already exist in Agda's standard library, others would have to be newly implemented;
% - Find minimal sets of assumptions that make the routing algorithms correct; and
% - Prove the correctness of the routing algorithms based on these assumptions in Agda.
